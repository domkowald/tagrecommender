# Tag Recommender Framework

## Description
The aim of this work is to provide the community with a simple to use, generic tag-recommender framework to evaluate novel tag-recommender algorithms with a set of well-known std. IR metrics such as MAP, MRR, P@k, R@k, F1@k and folksonomy datasets such as BibSonomy, CiteULike, LastFM or Delicious and to benchmark the developed approaches against state-of-the-art tag-recommender algorithms such as MP, MP_r, MP_u, MP_u,r, CF, APR, FR, GIRP, GIRPTM, etc.

Furthermore, it contains algorithms to process datasets (e.g., p-core pruning, leave-one-out splitting and LDA topic creation).

The software already contains three novel tag-recommender approaches based on cognitive science theory. The first one ([3Layers](http://www.christophtrattner.info/pubs/cikm2013.pdf)) uses topic information and is based on the ALCOVE theory (Krutschke et al., 1992). The second one ([BLL+C](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5111.pdf)) uses time information is based on the ACT-R theory (Anderson et al., 2004). The third one ([3LT](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.0728v1.pdf)) is a combination of the former two approaches and integrates the time component on the level of tags and topics.

## Download
The source-code can be directly checked-out through this repository. It contains an Eclipse project to edit and build it and an already deployed .jar file for direct execution. Furthermore, the folder structure that is provided in the repository is needed, where _csv_ is the input directory and _metrics_ is the output directory in the _data_ folder. Both of these directories contain subdirectories for the different datasets:
* bib_core for BibSonomy
* cul_core for CiteULike
* flickr_core for Flickr
* wiki_core for Wikipedia (based on bookmarks from Delicious)

## How-to-use
The _tagrecommender_ .jar uses three parameters:
First the algorithm:
* 3layers for 3Layers (based on ALCOVE theory) (Seitlinger et al., 2013)
* 3LT for the time-based 3Layers on the levels of tags and topics (Kowald et al., 2014a)
* bll_c for BLL and BLL+C (based on ACT-R theory) (Kowald et al., 2014b)
* lda for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Krestel et al., 2009)
* cf for Collaborative Filtering (Jäschke et al., 2007)
* fr for Adapted PageRank and FolkRank (Hotho et al., 2006)
* girptm for GIRP and GIRPTM (Zhang et al., 2012)
* mp for MostPopular tags
* mp_u_r for MostPopular tags by user and/or resource (Jäschke et al., 2007)
* core for calculating p-cores on a dataset
* split for splitting a dataset into training and test-sets using a leave-one-out method
* lda_samples for creating LDA topics for the resources in a dataset

, second the dataset(-directory):
* bib for BibSonomy
* cul for CiteULike
* flickr for Flickr
* wiki for Wikipedia (based on bookmarks from Delicious)

and third the filename (without file extension)

**Example:**
`java -jar tagrecommender.jar bll_c bib bib_sample`

## Input format
The input-files have to be placed in the corresponding subdirectory and are in csv-format (file extension: .txt) with 5 columns (quotation marks are mandatory):
* User
* Resource
* Timestamp in seconds
* List of tags
* List of categories (optional)

**Example:**
"0";"13830";"986470059";"deri,web2.0,tutorial,www,conference";""

There are three files needed:
* one file for training (with _train suffix)
* one file for testing (with _test suffix)
* one file that first contains the training-set and then the test-set (no suffix - is used for generating indices for the calculations)

**Example:**
bib_sample_train.txt, bib_sample_test.txt, bib_sample.txt (combination of train and test file)

## Output format
The output-file is generated in the corresponding subdirectory and is in csv-format with 5 columns:
* Recall
* Precision
* F1-score
* Mean Reciprocal Rank
* Mean Average Precision

for _k_ = 1 to 10 (each line is one _k_)

**Example:**
0,5212146123336273;0,16408544726301685;0,22663857529082376;0,26345775109372344;0,3242776089324113
